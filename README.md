# Google-Play-Store-Apps
This project analyzed the data set of our most used Google Play store app. And it's very interesting.

Welcome!
<p>
They are very happy to be hired as Junior Data Scientist at Google Play Store. As they said in the first interview, data science is very new to them, but as I said, I was able to convince them that it is one of the key factors for success in our digital world: data is life.

At their last board meeting, they decided to dedicate resources to building a new mobile app, and I have to say, they've gotten quite a few enthusiastic emails from their employees who want to be a part of the team.
They have different skills needed to make this project successful (marketing, design, game design, software engineer)

Before moving forward, he needs a market report. To complete the portfolio, this new app will be published first on the Google Play Store, so I can focus your research on it.

I'll ask a few questions here:

What is the market size?
number of downloads and $
Same question, but per category? (percentages please)
What is the proportion of downloads per app by category?
Any additional information that would be helpful for them to make an informed decision.
They remember me telling them I'm not a programmer, He's also an old programmer, so I think if I code it would be great to show my results in the terminal.
they told me:
I invite my vp marketing and vp designer to a meeting, formatting will be a real plus and be prepared to go back to the code if they have further questions.
